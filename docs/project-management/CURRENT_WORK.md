# Current Work Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-08-03 by Claude Code  
**Current Branch**: develop  
**Active Sprint**: Collaborative workflow setup

## Today's Focus
**PRIORITY**: Resolve ALB-EKS connectivity issue causing 504 Gateway Timeout

## Active Tasks

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with project management sections
- Created CURRENT_WORK.md coordination file
- Created handoff templates and GitHub issue templates
- Diagnosed ALB-EKS connectivity problem

### üöß In Progress
- **CRITICAL**: Fixing ALB 504 Gateway Timeout with EKS cluster

### üìã Next Up
- Install AWS Load Balancer Controller for EKS
- Test ALB connectivity after controller installation
- Validate Flask app accessibility through ALB

## Recent Changes
- Updated CLAUDE.md with tool coordination strategy
- Established project manager/senior developer role definitions
- **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**: ALB returning 504 Gateway Timeout due to missing AWS Load Balancer Controller

## Current Problem Analysis
**Issue**: ALB URL `http://dev-alb-859214336.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com` returns 504 Gateway Timeout  
**Root Cause**: EKS cluster deployed but missing AWS Load Balancer Controller for ingress handling  
**Impact**: Flask app pod is healthy but unreachable through ALB  

### What's Working:
- ‚úÖ EKS cluster: `dev-eks-cluster` active
- ‚úÖ Flask pod: Running and responding on port 8080
- ‚úÖ RDS database: Operational
- ‚úÖ ALB: Load balancer active but no healthy targets
- ‚úÖ Security groups: Properly configured

### What's Broken:
- ‚ùå ALB-to-EKS connectivity (504 Gateway Timeout)
- ‚ùå Ingress resource exists but no controller to handle it
- ‚ùå Manual target registration attempts failed

## Current Infrastructure State
- **Branch**: develop (ahead of main)
- **Modified Files**: Multiple terraform files, GitHub workflows
- **Pending Changes**: Various infrastructure updates in staging/dev
- **Last Deploy**: Staging environment operational
