# Current Work Status

**Active Sprint**: Template architecture development

## Today's Focus
**PRIORITY**: âœ… COMPLETED - EKS to ECS migration successful
**NEW FOCUS**: Template architecture documentation and optimization

## Active Tasks

### âœ… Completed
- Enhanced CLAUDE.md with project management sections
- Created CURRENT_WORK.md coordination file
- Created handoff templates and GitHub issue templates
- **RESOLVED**: ALB-EKS connectivity issue causing 504 Gateway Timeout
- **IMPLEMENTED**: EKS LoadBalancer service with automatic ELB provisioning
- **PRESERVED**: ALB functionality for ECS environments
- **BREAKTHROUGH**: Successfully migrated dev environment from EKS to ECS
- **SOLVED**: ECS public IP assignment issue (tasks stuck in PENDING)
- **DOCUMENTED**: Complete migration lessons and template architecture

### ðŸš§ In Progress
- Template architecture optimization
- Documentation cleanup and organization

### ðŸ“‹ Next Up
- Validate all conditional paths in template
- Performance optimization for specific environments
- CI/CD pipeline for template deployment
- Client project template preparation

## Recent Changes
- Updated CLAUDE.md with tool coordination strategy
- Established project manager/senior developer role definitions
- **ISSUE RESOLVED**: ALB-EKS connectivity issue fixed with LoadBalancer service approach
- **ARCHITECTURE IMPROVED**: Separated EKS and ECS load balancing strategies
- **MIGRATION SUCCESSFUL**: EKS to ECS migration completed with proper state management
- **TEMPLATE CREATED**: Versatile, conditional architecture for client projects

## Solution Implementation
**Approach**: Conditional architecture with environment-specific configurations
**Result**: Single codebase supporting EKS, ECS, and ASG
**Architecture**: Template-ready with clear separation of concerns

### What's Working:
- âœ… ECS cluster: `dev-ecs-cluster` active with 1 running task
- âœ… Flask app: Responding on ALB with database connectivity
- âœ… RDS database: Operational with populated contacts table
- âœ… **NEW**: ECS with public IP assignment for internet access
- âœ… **NEW**: Working endpoint: `http://dev-alb-1063583744.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/health/simple`
- âœ… **NEW**: Template architecture with conditional logic
- âœ… Security groups: Properly configured for ECS tasks

### Architecture Benefits:
- âœ… **Versatile**: Single codebase for multiple compute platforms
- âœ… **Reusable**: Drop-in template for client projects
- âœ… **Maintainable**: Clear conditional patterns
- âœ… **Cost-effective**: Environment-specific optimizations

## Current Infrastructure State
- **Branch**: feature/eks_to_ecs_migration
- **Modified Files**:
  - `modules/ecs/main.tf`: Added conditional public IP assignment
  - `modules/ecs/variables.tf`: Added enable_private_subnets variable
  - `environments/terraform/ecs-integration.tf`: Conditional subnet selection
  - `environments/terraform/dev.tfvars`: ECS configuration with public subnets
- **Last Deploy**: Dev environment with working ECS deployment
- **Working Endpoint**: `http://dev-alb-1063583744.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/health/simple`

## For Cursor Sessions
Start here:
- Check `docs/project-management/CURRENT_WORK.md` for latest status
- Review `docs/eks-to-ecs-migration-lessons.md` for template architecture
- Use `environments/terraform/dev.tfvars` for dev environment configuration
- Follow conditional patterns in module configurations

## Project Management Notes
- Daily coordination through CURRENT_WORK.md
- GitHub issues track larger features and initiatives
- Template architecture ready for client projects

## Blockers
None currently - all critical issues resolved

## Environment Status
- **Dev**: âœ… ECS + ALB working with public subnets
- **Staging**: Operational (ASG + ALB blue-green)
- **Production**: Stable (ASG + ALB blue-green)
- **Template**: Ready for client project deployment

## Template Architecture Status
- **Versatility**: âœ… Supports EKS, ECS, ASG
- **Conditionals**: âœ… Environment-aware configurations
- **Documentation**: âœ… Complete migration lessons
- **Reusability**: âœ… Ready for client projects
