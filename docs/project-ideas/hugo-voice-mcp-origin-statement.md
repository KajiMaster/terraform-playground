# Project Origin Statement: Hugo Voice MCP

**Date**: 2025-08-29  
**Status**: Conceptual  
**Type**: Developer Tool / Content Enhancement  

## Problem Statement

As I integrate AI assistance into my documentation workflow, I face a critical challenge: maintaining my authentic writing voice while leveraging AI's efficiency. Generated content often feels sterile, corporate, or "obviously AI" - which undermines the personal connection in portfolio pieces meant to showcase MY engineering journey.

## Vision

Create an MCP server that acts as a "voice guardian" for my Hugo portfolio site, learning from my approved writing samples to ensure all content - whether human or AI-assisted - maintains my authentic voice and technical communication style.

## Core Concept

### The MCP Server Would:

1. **Learn My Voice**
   - Analyze approved portfolio posts to understand my writing patterns
   - Identify my common phrases, technical explanations, and storytelling style
   - Build a profile of my preferred terminology and sentence structures

2. **Review & Score Content**
   - Rate new content on "authenticity score" (how much it sounds like me)
   - Flag obvious AI patterns I typically reject
   - Suggest rewrites that better match my voice

3. **Integrate with Content Pipeline**
   - Pre-publication review via MCP API
   - Real-time suggestions during writing
   - Batch processing for documentation migrations

## Technical Architecture Ideas

### MCP Server Components

```yaml
hugo-voice-mcp/
├── server/
│   ├── voice_analyzer.py      # Learns from approved content
│   ├── style_scorer.py        # Rates content authenticity
│   ├── rewrite_engine.py      # Suggests voice-matched alternatives
│   └── mcp_interface.py       # MCP protocol implementation
├── training_data/
│   ├── approved/              # My approved writing samples
│   ├── rejected/              # AI-generated content I've rejected
│   └── patterns.json          # Learned style patterns
├── hugo_integration/
│   ├── pre_commit_hook.sh     # Check content before commit
│   └── github_action.yml      # CI/CD integration
└── tools/
    ├── bulk_analyzer.py       # Analyze existing portfolio
    └── voice_report.py        # Generate style insights
```

### How It Would Work

1. **Training Phase**
   ```python
   # Pseudo-code concept
   class VoiceAnalyzer:
       def learn_from_approved(self, content):
           # Extract patterns like:
           # - Sentence length distribution
           # - Technical term usage
           # - Storytelling structures
           # - Problem-solution narrative flow
           # - Personal pronoun usage
           # - Humor/casual language frequency
   ```

2. **Analysis Phase**
   ```python
   class StyleScorer:
       def score_authenticity(self, new_content):
           return {
               "overall_score": 0.85,
               "flags": [
                   "Overly formal tone in paragraph 3",
                   "Missing personal insight section",
                   "Technical explanation too generic"
               ],
               "suggestions": [...]
           }
   ```

3. **Integration with Claude/AI Tools**
   - AI generates initial draft
   - MCP server reviews and scores
   - Suggests rewrites for low-scoring sections
   - Learn from my accept/reject decisions

## Unique Value Propositions

### For My Portfolio
- **Consistency**: All content maintains my voice, regardless of origin
- **Authenticity**: Readers get genuine personality, not corporate speak
- **Efficiency**: AI assistance without sacrificing personal touch

### For the Broader Community
- Could become a tool other developers use for their portfolios
- Open-source contribution to the MCP ecosystem
- Novel approach to the "AI detection" problem - embrace and improve rather than hide

## Success Metrics

1. **Voice Consistency Score**: 90%+ match across all portfolio content
2. **Time Saved**: 50% reduction in editing AI-generated drafts
3. **Reader Engagement**: Increased time on site (authentic content resonates)
4. **Developer Adoption**: Other devs using it for their portfolios

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Research & Prototype
- Study existing style analysis tools
- Build basic pattern extraction from my current portfolio
- Create simple scoring algorithm

### Phase 2: MCP Server Development
- Implement MCP protocol
- Build core voice analysis engine
- Create basic Hugo integration

### Phase 3: Training & Refinement
- Feed approved/rejected content pairs
- Refine scoring algorithms
- Build rewrite suggestion engine

### Phase 4: Full Integration
- GitHub Actions workflow
- Pre-commit hooks
- Real-time editor integration

## Open Questions

1. **Training Data Volume**: How many writing samples needed for accurate voice modeling?
2. **Pattern Complexity**: Can we capture subtle style elements like humor timing?
3. **Evolution Handling**: How does the system adapt as my writing style evolves?
4. **Privacy**: Should learned patterns be shareable or strictly personal?

## Potential Challenges

- **Overfitting**: System might become too restrictive, rejecting valid evolution
- **Context Awareness**: Different content types need different voices (technical vs narrative)
- **Performance**: Real-time analysis might slow down writing workflow
- **Maintenance**: Keeping training data current and relevant

## Related Projects to Research

- GitHub Copilot's context awareness
- Grammarly's tone detection
- OpenAI's fine-tuning approaches
- Existing MCP servers for content manipulation

## Next Steps

If pursuing this project:

1. **Create dedicated repository**: `hugo-voice-mcp`
2. **Analyze current portfolio**: Extract baseline voice patterns
3. **Build proof of concept**: Simple scorer for one metric (e.g., sentence length)
4. **Test with real content**: Score this very document!
5. **Iterate based on results**: Refine what "sounds like me" means

## Why This Matters

This isn't just about vanity or "sounding right" - it's about solving a real problem in the age of AI assistance. As developers, we want to leverage AI for efficiency, but our portfolios are personal brands. They need to reflect WHO we are, not just WHAT we've built. This MCP server could bridge that gap, making AI a true collaborator that enhances rather than replaces our voice.

## Connection to Current Work

This idea emerged from the terraform-playground documentation work, where I noticed:
- AI-generated documentation often missed my problem-solving narrative style
- Technical explanations lacked my specific teaching approach
- The "voice" difference was immediately noticeable

This tool would ensure that as I document projects like terraform-playground, the stories remain authentically mine while benefiting from AI's organizational and comprehensive capabilities.

*This origin statement itself could become training data - it's written in my voice, explaining my idea, in my typical problem-solution-vision format.*

## Repository Structure Vision

```
~/projects/
├── virtualexponent-website/      # Hugo site (could move up one level)
│   ├── content/
│   │   └── portfolio/           # Auto-populated from project docs
│   └── mcp-integrations/
│       └── hugo-voice-mcp/      # The MCP server
├── terraform-playground/
│   └── docs/
│       └── portfolio/           # Project-specific portfolio entries
├── curriculum-designer/
│   └── docs/

└── project-glish/
    └── docs/
        └── portfolio/           # Project-specific portfolio entries
```

The Hugo site could indeed live at a parent level, scanning down into each project's portfolio folder, while the MCP server ensures everything maintains your voice.

**Decision Point**: Is this worth pursuing as a standalone project, or should it remain a "someday maybe" idea?
