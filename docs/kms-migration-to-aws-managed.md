# KMS Migration: Custom Keys to AWS Managed Keys

## 🎯 Migration Overview

**Date**: June 2025  
**Goal**: Eliminate KMS Customer Managed Key (CMK) costs while maintaining security  
**Result**: $0 AWS account when infrastructure is destroyed

## 📊 Cost Analysis

### Before Migration
- **KMS CMK**: ~$1/month per key
- **Total for dev + staging**: ~$2.80/month
- **Deletion window**: 7 days (continues to cost during cleanup)

### After Migration
- **AWS Managed Keys**: $0/month
- **Total cost**: $0/month
- **Deletion window**: None (immediate cleanup)

**Savings**: ~$2.80/month (~$33.60/year)

## 🔧 Technical Changes

### 1. Secrets Module Updates
- **Removed**: `aws_kms_key` and `aws_kms_alias` resources
- **Simplified**: Secrets Manager now uses AWS default encryption
- **Maintained**: Random suffixes for deletion conflict prevention

### 2. IAM Policy Simplification
- **Removed**: Custom KMS decrypt permissions from EC2 instance role
- **Retained**: Limited KMS permissions for AWS managed keys in OIDC role
- **Maintained**: Secrets Manager access permissions

### 3. Security Impact
- **Encryption**: Still encrypted at rest using AWS managed keys
- **Security**: No reduction in security posture
- **Compliance**: Meets standard encryption requirements

## 🏗️ Architecture Decision

### Why AWS Managed Keys?
1. **Cost Efficiency**: Zero cost when infrastructure is destroyed
2. **Simplicity**: No key management overhead
3. **Learning Value**: Still demonstrates encryption concepts
4. **Portfolio**: Shows cost-conscious decision making

### When to Use Custom KMS Keys
- **Compliance Requirements**: Specific encryption standards
- **Key Rotation**: Custom rotation policies
- **Cross-Account Access**: Sharing keys across accounts
- **Audit Requirements**: Detailed key usage tracking

## 📈 Portfolio Value

### Skills Demonstrated
- **Cost Optimization**: Proactive cost management
- **Security Understanding**: Encryption at rest implementation
- **Decision Making**: Choosing appropriate encryption levels
- **Documentation**: Clear migration rationale

### Interview Talking Points
- "I migrated from custom KMS keys to AWS managed keys to achieve $0 costs when destroyed"
- "I understand when to use custom vs managed keys based on requirements"
- "I prioritize cost efficiency while maintaining security"

## 🚀 Implementation

### Migration Steps
1. **Updated secrets module** to remove KMS key creation
2. **Simplified IAM policies** to remove custom KMS permissions
3. **Updated documentation** to reflect AWS managed encryption
4. **Tested in dev environment** before staging deployment

### Validation
- ✅ Secrets Manager still encrypts data at rest
- ✅ Application functionality unchanged
- ✅ Zero cost when infrastructure destroyed
- ✅ Security posture maintained

## 📚 Lessons Learned

### Cost Management
- **Monitor AWS costs** regularly, even for learning projects
- **Consider deletion windows** when designing for cost efficiency
- **Balance features vs costs** based on project goals

### Security vs Cost
- **AWS managed keys** are sufficient for most use cases
- **Custom keys** add complexity and cost
- **Document decisions** for portfolio and learning purposes

### Infrastructure Design
- **Plan for destruction** from the beginning
- **Consider cleanup costs** in architecture decisions
- **Balance learning value** with practical constraints

---

**Note**: This migration demonstrates practical cost management skills while maintaining enterprise-grade security practices. The decision to use AWS managed keys shows understanding of when custom encryption is necessary vs when it adds unnecessary complexity and cost.
