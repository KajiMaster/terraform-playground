# Future Roadmap & Questions

This document captures questions, scenarios, and potential improvements for the Terraform playground without implementing them immediately. This helps maintain focus while ensuring we don't lose track of important considerations.

## ðŸŽ¯ Active Project: Blue-Green Deployment Implementation

### Project Overview
**Goal**: Implement blue-green deployment strategy to demonstrate enterprise-grade deployment patterns for career advancement.

**Why This Matters**: 
- High demand skill in DevOps interviews
- Demonstrates production deployment safety
- Shows understanding of zero-downtime deployments
- Aligns with current job market requirements

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation
- [ ] Add Application Load Balancer (ALB) to staging environment
- [ ] Create dual EC2 instance setup (blue/green environments)
- [ ] Implement health check endpoints in Flask application
- [ ] Add auto-scaling groups for each environment
- [ ] Configure target groups for traffic routing

#### Phase 2: Traffic Management
- [ ] Implement traffic switching logic
- [ ] Add deployment validation health checks
- [ ] Create rollback mechanisms
- [ ] Add deployment metrics and monitoring
- [ ] Implement gradual traffic shifting (optional)

#### Phase 3: CI/CD Integration
- [ ] Update GitHub Actions workflow for blue-green deployments
- [ ] Add deployment approval workflows
- [ ] Implement automated rollback triggers
- [ ] Add deployment status notifications
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

#### Phase 4: Production Readiness
- [ ] Add production environment with manual approval
- [ ] Implement cost monitoring and alerts
- [ ] Add disaster recovery procedures
- [ ] Create runbooks and operational procedures

### Technical Considerations
- **Environment**: Implement in staging environment (cost-effective, safe for experimentation)
- **Application**: Enhance current Flask app with health checks and simulated load
- **Database**: Ensure data consistency across blue/green environments
- **Monitoring**: Add CloudWatch dashboards for deployment visibility
- **Security**: Maintain existing security patterns (IAM, KMS, Secrets Manager)

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Zero-downtime deployments demonstrated
- [ ] Automated rollback on health check failures
- [ ] Deployment time under 5 minutes
- [ ] Cost increase under $50/month for staging
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation for portfolio

## Critical "Monkey Wrench" Scenarios (Priority 1)

### State Management Disasters
- [ ] What if someone accidentally runs `terraform destroy`?
- [ ] What if the S3 backend gets corrupted?
- [ ] What if multiple people try to apply simultaneously?
- [ ] What if state gets out of sync between environments?
- [ ] What if tfplan files get overwritten by concurrent developer pushes to shared environments?

### Authentication/Authorization Breakdowns
- [ ] What if the OIDC provider gets misconfigured?
- [ ] What if IAM roles lose permissions?
- [ ] What if someone's AWS credentials leak?
- [ ] What if the GitHub Actions role gets deleted?

### Resource Conflicts & Limits
- [ ] What if you hit AWS service limits?
- [ ] What if resources get orphaned outside Terraform?
- [ ] What if naming conflicts occur across environments?
- [ ] What if VPC CIDR ranges conflict?

## Real-World Additions (Priority 2)

### Team Scaling Issues
- [ ] What if multiple developers need to work simultaneously?
- [ ] What if someone breaks the shared global resources?
- [ ] What if you need to add more environments?
- [ ] What if you need feature branch isolation?
- [ ] How to handle shared infrastructure components (IGW, Subnets, EIPs) that need to persist across multiple dev projects?

### Production Readiness Gaps
- [ ] What if you need disaster recovery?
- [ ] What if you need compliance/auditing?
- [ ] What if you need cost controls?
- [ ] What if you need monitoring and alerting?

### Advanced Terraform Patterns
- [ ] How to handle cross-environment dependencies?
- [ ] How to implement blue-green deployments?
- [ ] How to add infrastructure testing?
- [ ] How to implement drift detection?
- [ ] How to isolate expensive/long-term components (ECS, Fargate, Docker) from core infrastructure for POC work?

## Technology Exploration Areas

### Monitoring & Observability
- [ ] CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- [ ] Application performance monitoring
- [ ] Log aggregation and analysis
- [ ] Infrastructure health checks

### Security Enhancements
- [ ] VPC endpoints for private communication
- [ ] WAF and security groups hardening
- [ ] Secrets rotation automation
- [ ] Compliance frameworks (SOC2, PCI, etc.)
- [ ] Replace PEM key management with SSM, Secrets Manager, or IAM-based authentication for EC2 instances

### Cost Optimization
- [ ] Cost allocation tags
- [ ] Budget alerts and controls
- [ ] Spot instances for cost savings
- [ ] Auto-scaling policies
- [ ] Audit and remove unused KMS keys (check if Customer Managed Keys are still needed)

### Advanced CI/CD
- [ ] Multi-environment promotion
- [ ] Rollback strategies
- [ ] Canary deployments
- [ ] Feature flag integration

## Questions for Future Sessions

### Architecture Decisions
- [ ] Should we add Kubernetes (EKS) to the mix?
- [ ] Should we explore serverless patterns?
- [ ] Should we implement multi-region deployment?
- [ ] Should we add data pipeline components?

### Operational Concerns
- [ ] How to handle database migrations?
- [ ] How to implement zero-downtime deployments?
- [ ] How to manage configuration drift?
- [ ] How to implement infrastructure testing?

### Team Workflow
- [ ] How to handle emergency deployments?
- [ ] How to implement approval workflows?
- [ ] How to manage environment-specific configurations?
- [ ] How to handle hotfixes?

### Module Management & Versioning
- [ ] When should modules be moved to separate repositories for versioning?
- [ ] How to handle module version conflicts between staging and production?
- [ ] How to prevent experimental module changes from accidentally updating production?
- [ ] How to implement module version promotion workflows?
- [ ] How to manage module dependencies across environments safely?

## Notes for Next Session

When starting a new chat session, provide this context:

1. **Project**: Terraform playground with GitFlow CI/CD
2. **Current State**: Working staging environment with OIDC authentication
3. **Architecture**: Multi-environment with global resources
4. **Key Files**: 
   - `.github/workflows/staging-terraform.yml` - CI/CD pipeline
   - `environments/staging/` - Staging environment
   - `environments/global/` - OIDC provider
   - `modules/` - Reusable Terraform modules

5. **Recent Achievements**:
   - âœ… Working CI/CD pipeline with OIDC
   - âœ… Automated database bootstrapping
   - âœ… Multi-environment structure
   - âœ… Comprehensive documentation

6. **Next Priority**: Choose one area from this roadmap to focus on

## Session Planning

For each new session:
1. Review this roadmap
2. Pick ONE area to focus on
3. Implement incrementally
4. Test thoroughly
5. Update documentation
6. Add new questions to this roadmap

This approach ensures steady progress without overwhelming complexity.
