# Case Study: The Database Schema Mismatch Mystery
## When Identical Infrastructure Hides Environment-Specific Issues

**Date**: July 30, 2025  
**Environment**: Production vs Staging  
**Issue Type**: Application-level database schema mismatch  
**Resolution Time**: ~2 hours  
**Root Cause**: Missing database bootstrap in production environment

## üö® The Problem

### Initial Symptoms
- **Production**: `http://production-alb-882611019.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/contacts` returns **500 Internal Server Error**
- **Staging**: `http://staging-alb-1060724333.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/` returns **200 OK** with proper JSON response
- **Infrastructure**: Both environments deployed from identical Terraform configurations
- **Application**: Same container image, same codebase, same deployment process

### The Confusion
> "Everything is identical. I'm losing hair figuring this out."

This was a classic case where **infrastructure parity ‚â† application parity**. The environments were identical at the infrastructure level but had a critical difference at the application level.

## üîç The Troubleshooting Journey

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Investigation (30 minutes)

#### Attempt 1: AMI Version Differences
**Hypothesis**: Different AMI versions causing compatibility issues

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Checked AMI IDs in tfvars files
grep_search "ami_id" *.tfvars

# Results:
# production.tfvars: ami_id = "ami-0c02fb55956c7d316"
# staging.tfvars: ami_id = "ami-0c7217cdde317cfec"  # Amazon Linux 2023
```

**Finding**: Different AMI IDs, but both were invalid (didn't exist in region)

**Action**: Verified staging was working despite invalid AMI, so this wasn't the root cause

#### Attempt 2: ECS Service Comparison
**Hypothesis**: Different ECS task definitions or service configurations

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Compared task definitions
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition staging-blue-task:19
aws ecs describe-task-definition --task-definition production-blue-task:4
```

**Finding**: Identical task definitions, same container image, same environment variables (except DB_NAME/DB_HOST)

**Action**: Ruled out ECS configuration differences

#### Attempt 3: Network and Security Groups
**Hypothesis**: Network connectivity or security group issues

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Checked ALB health status
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <production-tg-arn>
aws elbv2 describe-target-health --target-group-arn <staging-tg-arn>
```

**Finding**: Both environments had healthy targets, ALB was routing traffic correctly

**Action**: Network infrastructure was functioning properly

### Phase 2: Application-Level Investigation (45 minutes)

#### Attempt 4: Container Health Checks
**Hypothesis**: Application failing to start or health checks failing

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Checked ECS service status
aws ecs describe-services --cluster production-ecs-cluster --services production-blue-service
aws ecs describe-services --cluster staging-ecs-cluster --services staging-blue-service
```

**Finding**: Both services had 1 running task, desired count met, no deployment issues

**Action**: Application containers were running successfully

#### Attempt 5: The Critical Breakthrough - CloudWatch Logs
**Hypothesis**: Application errors in container logs

**Investigation**:
```bash
# Found the correct log group names from global state
# /aws/application/tf-playground/production
# /aws/application/tf-playground/staging

# Retrieved recent application logs
aws logs get-log-events \
  --log-group-name "/aws/application/tf-playground/production" \
  --log-stream-name "ecs-blue/flask-app/6e65d1a61f714c1ea05f8f05015edd7a" \
  --start-time $(date -d '30 minutes ago' +%s)000
```

**The Smoking Gun**:
```
sqlalchemy.exc.ProgrammingError: (pymysql.err.ProgrammingError) (1146, "Table 'tfplayground_prod.contacts' doesn't exist")
[SQL: SELECT contacts.id, contacts.name, contacts.email, contacts.phone, contacts.created_at 
FROM contacts 
 LIMIT %s, %s]
```

**Finding**: **Database schema mismatch!** Production database missing the `contacts` table

## üéØ Root Cause Analysis

### The Real Issue
The problem wasn't infrastructure-related at all. It was an **application-level database schema issue**:

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**: ‚úÖ Both environments deployed successfully
2. **Database Creation**: ‚úÖ Both RDS instances created and accessible
3. **Application Deployment**: ‚úÖ Both ECS services running same container image
4. **Database Schema**: ‚ùå Production database never bootstrapped with application schema

### Why This Happened
- **Staging**: Database was bootstrapped during initial setup
- **Production**: Database was created but never had the `contacts` table created
- **Infrastructure Parity**: Both environments had identical infrastructure
- **Application Setup**: Only staging had the application-specific database schema

### The Pattern
This is a common enterprise pattern where:
- **Infrastructure Teams**: Deploy platform (ECS, RDS, ALB, etc.)
- **Application Teams**: Handle application-specific setup (database schemas, seed data)
- **Deployment Process**: Infrastructure deployment ‚â† application setup

---

## üõ†Ô∏è The Resolution

### Step 1: Database Bootstrap Discovery
Found the existing database bootstrap script:
```bash
# Located the ECS database bootstrap script
read_file "environments/terraform/ecs-database-bootstrap.sh"
```

### Step 2: Production Database Bootstrap
```bash
# Executed the bootstrap script for production
cd environments/terraform
./ecs-database-bootstrap.sh production
```

**Process**:
1. **ECS Exec** connected to running production task
2. **Created SQL file** in container with table creation and sample data
3. **Executed SQL** against production RDS instance
4. **Verified** 5 contacts were created successfully

### Step 3: Verification
```bash
# Tested the production endpoint
curl -s http://production-alb-882611019.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com/contacts | jq .

# Result: Perfect JSON response with 5 contacts
```

## üìö Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Infrastructure ‚â† Application
- **Infrastructure parity** doesn't guarantee **application parity**
- Database schemas are application concerns, not infrastructure concerns
- Always verify application-level setup across environments

### 2. Logs Are Your Friend
- **CloudWatch logs** provided the critical breakthrough
- Application errors often reveal infrastructure vs. application issues
- Know your log group naming conventions

### 3. Systematic Troubleshooting
- **Start with infrastructure** (AMI, ECS, networking)
- **Move to application level** (containers, health checks)
- **End with data layer** (database connectivity, schemas)
- **Follow the data** - let error messages guide your investigation

### 4. Environment-Specific Setup
- **Infrastructure deployment** is environment-agnostic
- **Application setup** (schemas, seed data) is environment-specific
- **Document the difference** between infrastructure and application deployment

### 5. The Power of Identical Environments
- **Identical infrastructure** made troubleshooting easier
- **Eliminated variables** - could focus on application-level differences
- **Proved the value** of infrastructure-as-code consistency

## üîß Prevention Strategies

### 1. Automated Database Bootstrap
```yaml
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
- name: Bootstrap Database
  run: |
    if [ "${{ github.ref }}" == "refs/heads/main" ]; then
      ./ecs-database-bootstrap.sh production
    fi
```

### 2. Database Schema Validation
```python
# Add health check endpoint
@app.get("/health/database")
async def database_health():
    try:
        result = await db.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM contacts")
        return {"status": "healthy", "contact_count": result}
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}
```

### 3. Environment Promotion Checklist
- [ ] Infrastructure deployed
- [ ] Database bootstrapped
- [ ] Application health checks passing
- [ ] Sample data verified
- [ ] Performance metrics baseline

### 4. Monitoring and Alerting
```hcl
# CloudWatch alarm for database errors
resource "aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm" "database_errors" {
  alarm_name = "database-errors-${var.environment}"
  comparison_operator = "GreaterThanThreshold"
  evaluation_periods = "1"
  metric_name = "Errors"
  namespace = "AWS/ECS"
  period = "300"
  statistic = "Sum"
  threshold = "0"
}
```
