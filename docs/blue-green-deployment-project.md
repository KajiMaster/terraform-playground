## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Current State
```
Internet ‚Üí EC2 Instance (Single) ‚Üí RDS Database
```

### Target State (Blue-Green)
```
Internet ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí Target Group (Blue) ‚Üí EC2 Blue Instance ‚Üí RDS Database
                    ‚Üì
              Target Group (Green) ‚Üí EC2 Green Instance ‚Üí RDS Database

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Application Enhancements

#### Enhanced Health Check Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    try:
        # Database connectivity check
        db_status = check_database_connection()
        
        # Application readiness check
        app_status = check_application_readiness()
        
        # External service checks (if applicable)
        external_status = check_external_services()
        
        return {
            "status": "healthy" if all([db_status, app_status, external_status]) else "unhealthy",
            "database": db_status,
            "application": app_status,
            "external_services": external_status,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}, 500
```

#### Deployment Validation Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/deployment/validate')
def deployment_validation():
    # Comprehensive validation for new deployments
    checks = {
        "database_connectivity": check_database_connection(),
        "application_functionality": test_core_functions(),
        "performance": check_response_times(),
        "memory_usage": check_memory_usage(),
        "disk_space": check_disk_space()
    }
    
    all_passed = all(checks.values())
    return {
        "deployment_ready": all_passed,
        "checks": checks,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
```

### Infrastructure Components

#### ALB Configuration
- **Type**: Application Load Balancer
- **Scheme**: Internet-facing
- **Security Groups**: Allow HTTP/HTTPS from internet
- **Target Groups**: Separate groups for blue and green
- **Health Checks**: Custom health check endpoint

#### Auto Scaling Groups
- **Blue Environment**: ASG for blue instances
- **Green Environment**: ASG for green instances
- **Scaling Policies**: CPU-based auto-scaling
- **Health Checks**: ALB health checks

#### Traffic Switching Strategy
1. **Deploy to inactive environment** (green if blue is active)
2. **Run health checks** on new environment
3. **Gradually shift traffic** (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
4. **Monitor for issues** during traffic shift
5. **Rollback if problems detected**

## üß™ Failover Testing Procedures

### Overview
This section documents the **verified and tested** failover procedures that have been successfully validated in the dev environment. These procedures ensure zero-downtime deployments work correctly.

### ‚úÖ Verified Test Scenarios

#### 1. **Blue to Green Traffic Switch Test** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Objective**: Test switching traffic from blue to green environment

**Prerequisites**:
- Blue environment is active and serving traffic
- Green environment is ready with application running
- Both environments pass health checks

**Verified Test Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Verify current state (should show blue)
curl -s $(terraform output -raw application_url) | jq .deployment_color
# Expected: "blue"

# 2. Switch traffic to green (this is the key step)
aws elbv2 modify-listener \
  --listener-arn $(terraform output -raw http_listener_arn) \
  --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=$(terraform output -raw green_target_group_arn) \
  --region us-east-2

# 3. Wait for health checks to complete (10-15 seconds)
sleep 15

# 4. Verify traffic is now going to green
curl -s $(terraform output -raw application_url) | jq .deployment_color
# Expected: "green"

# 5. Verify green target group is healthy
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn $(terraform output -raw green_target_group_arn) \
  --region us-east-2
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Zero downtime during switch
- ‚úÖ Application responds with `deployment_color: "green"`
- ‚úÖ Green target group shows healthy status
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity maintained

#### 2. **Green to Blue Rollback Test** ‚úÖ VERIFIED
**Objective**: Test rolling back from green to blue environment

**Prerequisites**:
- Green environment is active and serving traffic
- Blue environment is ready with application running

**Verified Test Steps**:
```bash
# 1. Verify current state (should show green)
curl -s $(terraform output -raw application_url) | jq .deployment_color
# Expected: "green"

# 2. Switch traffic back to blue
aws elbv2 modify-listener \
  --listener-arn $(terraform output -raw http_listener_arn) \
  --default-actions Type=forward,TargetGroupArn=$(terraform output -raw blue_target_group_arn) \
  --region us-east-2

# 3. Wait for health checks to complete (10-15 seconds)
sleep 15

# 4. Verify traffic is back to blue
curl -s $(terraform output -raw application_url) | jq .deployment_color
# Expected: "blue"

# 5. Verify blue target group is healthy
aws elbv2 describe-target-health \
  --target-group-arn $(terraform output -raw blue_target_group_arn) \
  --region us-east-2
```

**Expected Results**:
- ‚úÖ Zero downtime during rollback
- ‚úÖ Application responds with `deployment_color: "blue"`
- ‚úÖ Blue target group shows healthy status
- ‚úÖ No 502 errors (previously encountered issue resolved)
- ‚úÖ Database connectivity maintained

### üîß Key Insights from Testing

#### **What Works**:
1. **ALB Listener Modification**: Direct traffic switching via `aws elbv2 modify-listener` is reliable
2. **Health Check Timing**: 10-15 second wait after traffic switch ensures health checks complete
3. **Target Group Health**: Both blue and green target groups maintain healthy status
4. **Application Response**: Both environments respond correctly with proper deployment color

#### **What Was Resolved**:
1. **502 Error Issue**: Previously encountered 502 errors during green-to-blue rollback were likely due to timing
2. **Health Check Lag**: Waiting for health checks to complete prevents premature testing
3. **Instance State**: Both environments maintain stable application state

#### **Best Practices Identified**:
1. **Always wait 10-15 seconds** after traffic switches before testing
2. **Verify target group health** before and after switches
3. **Test both `/` and `/health` endpoints** for complete validation
4. **Monitor application logs** during switches for any issues

```

### Monitoring and Validation

#### **Real-time Health Monitoring**
```bash
# Monitor health during failover
watch -n 5 'curl -s $(terraform output -raw health_check_url) | jq .'
```

#### **Traffic Flow Validation**
```bash
# Check which target group is receiving traffic
aws elbv2 describe-listeners \
  --listener-arns $(terraform output -raw http_listener_arn) \
  --region us-east-2 \
  --query 'Listeners[0].DefaultActions[0].TargetGroupArn'
```

#### **Performance Metrics**
```bash
# Monitor response times during failover
for i in {1..10}; do
  time curl -s $(terraform output -raw health_check_url) > /dev/null
  sleep 1
done
```
