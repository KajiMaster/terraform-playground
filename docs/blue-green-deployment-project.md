# Blue-Green Deployment Project

## üéØ Project Mission

Implement a comprehensive blue-green deployment strategy to demonstrate enterprise-grade deployment patterns for career advancement and skill showcase.

## üìã Project Overview

### Goals
- Demonstrate zero-downtime deployment capabilities
- Showcase advanced CI/CD automation skills
- Implement production-ready deployment safety measures
- Create portfolio-worthy infrastructure patterns

### Why Blue-Green Deployments Matter
- **High Demand**: Frequently mentioned in DevOps job postings
- **Risk Mitigation**: Eliminates deployment downtime and rollback complexity
- **Production Safety**: Industry standard for critical applications
- **Career Impact**: Shows advanced infrastructure automation skills

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Design

### Current State
```
Internet ‚Üí EC2 Instance (Single) ‚Üí RDS Database
```

### Target State (Blue-Green)
```
Internet ‚Üí ALB ‚Üí Target Group (Blue) ‚Üí EC2 Blue Instance ‚Üí RDS Database
                    ‚Üì
              Target Group (Green) ‚Üí EC2 Green Instance ‚Üí RDS Database
```

### Key Components
1. **Application Load Balancer (ALB)**: Traffic distribution and health checks
2. **Target Groups**: Separate groups for blue and green environments
3. **Auto Scaling Groups**: Manage EC2 instances for each environment
4. **Health Checks**: Validate deployment success before traffic switching
5. **Database**: Shared RDS instance (simplified approach for demo)

## üîß Technical Specifications

### Application Enhancements

#### Enhanced Health Check Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/health')
def health_check():
    try:
        # Database connectivity check
        db_status = check_database_connection()
        
        # Application readiness check
        app_status = check_application_readiness()
        
        # External service checks (if applicable)
        external_status = check_external_services()
        
        return {
            "status": "healthy" if all([db_status, app_status, external_status]) else "unhealthy",
            "database": db_status,
            "application": app_status,
            "external_services": external_status,
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
        }
    except Exception as e:
        return {"status": "unhealthy", "error": str(e)}, 500
```

#### Deployment Validation Endpoint
```python
@app.route('/deployment/validate')
def deployment_validation():
    # Comprehensive validation for new deployments
    checks = {
        "database_connectivity": check_database_connection(),
        "application_functionality": test_core_functions(),
        "performance": check_response_times(),
        "memory_usage": check_memory_usage(),
        "disk_space": check_disk_space()
    }
    
    all_passed = all(checks.values())
    return {
        "deployment_ready": all_passed,
        "checks": checks,
        "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat()
    }
```

### Infrastructure Components

#### ALB Configuration
- **Type**: Application Load Balancer
- **Scheme**: Internet-facing
- **Security Groups**: Allow HTTP/HTTPS from internet
- **Target Groups**: Separate groups for blue and green
- **Health Checks**: Custom health check endpoint

#### Auto Scaling Groups
- **Blue Environment**: ASG for blue instances
- **Green Environment**: ASG for green instances
- **Scaling Policies**: CPU-based auto-scaling
- **Health Checks**: ALB health checks

#### Traffic Switching Strategy
1. **Deploy to inactive environment** (green if blue is active)
2. **Run health checks** on new environment
3. **Gradually shift traffic** (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)
4. **Monitor for issues** during traffic shift
5. **Rollback if problems detected**

## üí∞ Cost Considerations

### Blue-Green Staging Environment
- 2x EC2 Instances: ~$30/month
- ALB: ~$20/month
- RDS Instance: ~$25/month
- **Total**: ~$75/month
- **Additional Cost**: ~$35/month

### Cost Optimization Strategies
- Use t3.micro instances for development
- Implement auto-stop for non-production hours
