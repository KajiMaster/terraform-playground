# Archived Documentation

## Overview

This directory contains documentation that has been archived to maintain a clean, portfolio-focused repository. These documents are kept for historical reference and internal use but are not part of the main project documentation.

## Archived Files

### **Planning and Design Documents**
- `sketch-01-environment-hierarchy.md` - Early environment design sketches

- `sketch-04-state-management.md` - State management design
- `sketch-05-module-dependencies.md` - Module dependency planning
- `sketch-06-environment-variables.md` - Environment variable design

### **Historical Implementation Documents**
- `ai-briefing.md` - Outdated AI context (references old Git sync issues)
- `version-2-improvements.md` - Historical improvements summary

- `avid-tf-tech.md` - Technical notes (content unknown)
- `strategic-prioritization-and-decision-making.md` - Consolidated into lessons-learned.md

### **Advanced Workflow Documents**
- `team-development-workflow.md` - Detailed team workflow (too detailed for portfolio)
- `ci-cd-crossroads-case-study.md` - CI/CD case study
- `solo-multi-project-workflow.md` - Advanced workflow patterns

## Why These Were Archived

### **Portfolio Focus**
- **Clean Repository**: Only showcase current, relevant work
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear, focused documentation
- **Professional Appearance**: Organized, portfolio-ready structure

### **Current Relevance**
- **Outdated Content**: References old issues and workflows
- **Redundant Information**: Duplicated in current documentation
- **Over-Detailed**: Too much information for portfolio purposes
- **Consolidated**: Key insights moved to active documentation

### **Maintenance Efficiency**
- **Easier Updates**: Fewer documents to maintain
- **Clear Priorities**: Focus on current project needs
- **Reduced Clutter**: Easier navigation for potential employers

## Current Active Documentation

The main `docs/` directory now contains only portfolio-relevant documentation:

- `README.md` - Main project overview
- `blue-green-deployment-project.md` - Active project documentation
- `database-bootstrap.md` - Essential operational guide
- `kms-migration-to-aws-managed.md` - Cost optimization documentation
- `lessons-learned.md` - Real human notes from hands-on experience
- `git-gitflow-lessons.md` - Practical Git and GitFlow workflows
- `future-roadmap.md` - Project planning and roadmap

## Accessing Archived Content

These documents are still available for:
- **Historical Reference**: Understanding project evolution
- **Internal Use**: Team reference and learning
- **Future Planning**: Ideas for future enhancements
- **Learning Journey**: Documentation of growth and progress

## Restoration

If any of these documents become relevant again, they can be moved back to the main `docs/` directory. This archive serves as a "time capsule" of the project's development journey.
