# Archived Documentation

## Why These Were Archived

### **Portfolio Focus**
- **Clean Repository**: Only showcase current, relevant work
- **Reduced Confusion**: Clear, focused documentation
- **Professional Appearance**: Organized, portfolio-ready structure

### **Current Relevance**
- **Outdated Content**: References old issues and workflows that have been resolved
- **Redundant Information**: Duplicated in current documentation
- **Over-Detailed**: Too much information for portfolio purposes
- **Consolidated**: Key insights moved to active documentation
- **Historical**: Past problems that have been solved

### **Maintenance Efficiency**
- **Easier Updates**: Fewer documents to maintain
- **Clear Priorities**: Focus on current project needs
- **Reduced Clutter**: Easier navigation for potential employers

## Current Active Documentation

The main `docs/` directory now contains only portfolio-relevant documentation:

- `README.md` - Documentation index and overview
- `blue-green-deployment-project.md` - **COMPLETED** blue-green deployment implementation
- `blue-green-failover-quick-reference.md` - Quick commands for testing
- `database-bootstrap.md` - Essential operational guide
- `kms-migration-to-aws-managed.md` - Cost optimization documentation

## Accessing Archived Content

These documents are still available for:
- **Historical Reference**: Understanding project evolution
- **Internal Use**: Team reference and learning
- **Future Planning**: Ideas for future enhancements
- **Learning Journey**: Documentation of growth and progress

## Restoration

If any of these documents become relevant again, they can be moved back to the main `docs/` directory. This archive serves as a "time capsule" of the project's development journey.
