# 🔄 **Case Study: Terraform Circular Dependency in Security Group Configuration**

## 📋 **Executive Summary**

**Issue**: 504/500 errors when accessing Application Load Balancer (ALB) endpoints in a blue-green deployment infrastructure, caused by a circular dependency between ALB and webserver security groups in Terraform.

**Root Cause**: Cross-referencing security groups created an unresolvable dependency cycle that prevented Terraform from determining the correct resource creation order.

**Solution**: Broke the circular dependency by using separate `aws_security_group_rule` resources instead of inline security group rules.

**Impact**: Resolved network connectivity issues and restored proper ALB-to-EC2 communication in the blue-green deployment architecture.

---

## 🎯 **Context & Background**

### **Infrastructure Overview**
- **Multi-environment Terraform project** with blue-green deployment strategy
- **Centralized security group management** (moved from individual modules to networking module)
- **Application Load Balancer** with dual target groups (blue/green)
- **Auto Scaling Groups** for zero-downtime deployments
- **RDS database** in private subnets

### **Recent Changes**
- Consolidated security group creation from individual modules to centralized networking module
- Implemented blue-green deployment architecture with ALB traffic switching
- Centralized approach was intended to resolve naming conflicts and duplication issues

---

## 🚨 **Problem Identification**

### **Symptoms**
- **504 Gateway Timeout** errors when accessing ALB endpoints
- **500 Internal Server Error** responses from load balancer
- Terraform apply failing with circular dependency errors
- ALB health checks failing to reach EC2 instances

### **Initial Investigation Steps**
1. **Network connectivity testing** - Verified VPC, subnets, and routing
2. **Security group review** - Checked ingress/egress rules
3. **ALB configuration** - Verified target groups and health checks
4. **EC2 instance health** - Confirmed instances were running and healthy

### **Key Discovery**
The error message revealed the core issue:
```
Error: Cycle: module.networking.aws_security_group.webserver, module.networking.aws_security_group.alb
```

---

## 🔍 **Root Cause Analysis**

### **The Circular Dependency**
```hcl
# ALB Security Group
resource "aws_security_group" "alb" {
  egress {
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.webserver.id]  # References webserver SG
  }
}

# Webserver Security Group  
resource "aws_security_group" "webserver" {
  ingress {
    security_groups = [aws_security_group.alb.id]  # References ALB SG
  }
}
```

### **Why This Happens**
1. **ALB SG** needs to reference **Webserver SG** for egress rules
2. **Webserver SG** needs to reference **ALB SG** for ingress rules
3. Terraform cannot determine which resource to create first
4. **Result**: Circular dependency error and failed deployments

### **Why It Wasn't Obvious**
- Security group rules appeared logically correct
- The circular reference was subtle and easy to miss
- Previous working configuration had different architecture
- Centralization of security groups changed the dependency pattern

---

## 🛠️ **Solution Implementation**

### **Step 1: Break the Circular Dependency**
Replaced inline security group rules with separate `aws_security_group_rule` resources:

```hcl
# Create security groups without cross-references
resource "aws_security_group" "alb" {
  # Only ingress rules from internet
  # No egress rules (added separately)
}

resource "aws_security_group" "webserver" {
  # Only SSH ingress and general egress
  # No ALB ingress rules (added separately)
}

# Add cross-referencing rules separately
resource "aws_security_group_rule" "alb_webserver_egress" {
  type                     = "egress"
  from_port                = 8080
  to_port                  = 8080
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.webserver.id
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.alb.id
}

resource "aws_security_group_rule" "webserver_alb_ingress" {
  type                     = "ingress"
  from_port                = 8080
  to_port                  = 8080
  protocol                 = "tcp"
  source_security_group_id = aws_security_group.alb.id
  security_group_id        = aws_security_group.webserver.id
}
```

### **Step 2: Clean Up Unused Variables**
- Removed `webserver_security_group_ids` from database module
- Simplified module interfaces to avoid unnecessary complexity
- Ensured all security group relationships are managed centrally

### **Step 3: Verify Resource Creation Order**
The new approach ensures proper creation order:
1. **ALB Security Group** (no dependencies)
2. **Webserver Security Group** (no dependencies)
3. **Security Group Rules** (can reference both groups)

## 📊 **Results & Validation**

### **Before Fix**
- ❌ Terraform apply failed with circular dependency
- ❌ ALB returned 504/500 errors
- ❌ Health checks failed
- ❌ No traffic flow between ALB and EC2 instances

### **After Fix**
- ✅ Terraform apply completed successfully
- ✅ ALB endpoints responding correctly
- ✅ Health checks passing
- ✅ Proper traffic flow established
