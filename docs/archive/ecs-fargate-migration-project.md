# ECS Fargate Migration Project - ARCHIVED

> **‚ö†Ô∏è ARCHIVED**: This document has been moved to archive as the project has pivoted to focus on blue-green deployments with EC2 ASG, which has been successfully completed. The ECS migration represents a different architectural direction that is not currently being pursued.

## üéØ Project Overview

**Goal**: Migrate the Terraform playground from EC2 Auto Scaling Groups (ASG) to ECS Fargate for containerized deployments, demonstrating modern containerization and orchestration skills.

**Status**: ARCHIVED - Project direction changed to focus on blue-green deployment patterns instead.

**Current Focus**: Blue-green deployment implementation has been completed successfully. See `blue-green-deployment-project.md` for the implemented solution.

**Why This Was Considered**: 
- High demand skill in DevOps/Platform Engineering interviews
- Demonstrates containerization and orchestration knowledge
- Shows ability to modernize existing infrastructure
- Aligns with current industry trends toward containerization

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decision Framework

### **Why ECS Fargate Over Alternatives**

#### **ECS Fargate (Chosen)**
- **AWS Native**: Integrates seamlessly with existing AWS infrastructure
- **Terraform Support**: Excellent provider support and documentation
- **Cost Control**: Serverless, scales to zero, manageable for demo environments
- **Learning Value**: High demand skill, shows containerization + orchestration
- **Complexity**: Medium - manageable learning curve

#### **Kubernetes (EKS) - Rejected**
- **High Complexity**: Significant learning curve for K8s concepts
- **Resource Intensive**: Requires multiple EC2 instances for control plane + workers
- **Cost**: Much more expensive (~$50-100+/month minimum)
- **Overkill**: For single web app, adds complexity without proportional benefit

#### **Docker on EC2 - Rejected**
- **Limited Learning**: Just containerization, no orchestration
- **Manual Management**: No built-in scaling, health checks, or deployment features
- **Less Marketable**: Doesn't demonstrate modern orchestration skills

### **Migration Strategy: Gradual with Backwards Compatibility**

#### **Key Decision: Keep ASG Module During Migration**
```
Current Structure (Perfect for Migration):
modules/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ loadbalancer/     # ALB + target groups (INDEPENDENT)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ compute/asg/      # EC2 ASG (KEEP DURING MIGRATION)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [new] ecs/        # ECS cluster + services (NEW)
```

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- **Zero Risk**: Existing ASG continues working during ECS development
- **Parallel Testing**: Can test ECS alongside ASG
- **Easy Rollback**: Just switch ALB back to ASG target groups
- **Gradual Migration**: Move one environment at a time

## üí∞ Cost Analysis

### **Current Costs (ASG)**
- **EC2 Instances**: $15-30/month (t3.micro)
- **ALB**: $20-25/month
- **Total**: ~$35-55/month

### **New Costs (ECS Fargate)**
- **ECR Storage**: $1-5/month (can be purged daily)
- **ECS Fargate**: $20-40/month (0.5 vCPU, 1GB memory)
- **ALB**: $20-25/month (unchanged)
- **Data Transfer**: $1-3/month
- **Total**: ~$42-73/month

### **Cost Optimization Strategies**
- **Auto-scaling**: Scale to 0 tasks when not in use
- **Image optimization**: Smaller Docker images = less ECR storage
- **Scheduled scaling**: Scale down during off-hours
- **Daily cleanup**: Purge ECR images when destroying infrastructure

## üîÑ Blue-Green Deployment with ECS

### **How It Works:**
1. **Blue ECS Service**: Currently receiving traffic
2. **Green ECS Service**: Deploy new version here
3. **ALB Switch**: Change ALB listener to point to green target group
4. **Rollback**: Switch back to blue if issues

### **ECS Advantages:**
- **Built-in health checks**: ECS monitors container health
- **Automatic rollback**: Can configure automatic rollback on health failures
- **Gradual deployment**: Can use `deployment_circuit_breaker` and `deployment_controller`

## üöÄ Career Benefits

This project demonstrates:
- **Modern Infrastructure**: Containerization and orchestration
- **Migration Skills**: Ability to modernize existing infrastructure
- **Risk Management**: Gradual migration with rollback capability
- **Cost Optimization**: Understanding of container costs and optimization
- **CI/CD Integration**: Automated container deployment pipelines

## üìù Notes for Implementation

### **Key Decisions Made**
1. **ECS Fargate over EKS**: Simpler, more cost-effective for demo
2. **Gradual migration**: Keep ASG during transition for safety
3. **ALB independence**: Load balancer module stays unchanged
4. **Daily cleanup**: Purge ECR images to minimize costs
5. **Parameter Store over Secrets Manager**: Cost-effective secrets management
6. **Hybrid secrets approach**: Environment variables for local, Parameter Store for cloud
7. **Blue-green with listener rules**: Green service accessible via `/green*` paths
8. **Staging environment focus**: Use staging over dev due to sync issues

### **Risk Mitigation**
- **Parallel testing**: ECS runs alongside ASG during development
- **Easy rollback**: Can switch back to ASG if issues arise
- **Environment isolation**: Test in staging before production
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for troubleshooting
- **Security group isolation**: ECS tasks in private subnets with controlled access
- **IAM least privilege**: Specific permissions for ECS tasks and Parameter Store

### **Future Considerations**
- **Multi-service architecture**: ECS can easily support multiple containers
- **Service mesh**: Could add App Mesh for advanced networking
- **Monitoring**: CloudWatch Container Insights for ECS monitoring
- **Security**: ECS task roles and security groups optimization
